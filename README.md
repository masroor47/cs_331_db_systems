# CSCI 331 Database Systems

This is a repository for my Database Systems class. Going to code some database stuff.


### How to run locally
Clone this repo, create a virtual environment and activate it.
```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```
Install the requirements.
```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Then navigate to whatever assignment you want and run it for yourself. Oh wait, but you have to make sure your database is running. And it has to have the exact correct schemas and names like in the textbook.

Actually, it's too complicated, don't bother running it.
