### Accessing SQL from a programming language

### JDBC
* Java API for communicating with database systems supporting SQL
* Supports variety of features
* Supports metadata retrieval
* How to:
    * Open a connection
    * Create a "statement" object
    *

See examples

### SQL Injection
Say you are contcatinating strings for selects or inserts. 
You could insert sql code to where you are adding variables.

### Transaction Control
* wraps several statements together

### Functions and Procedures
* can use programming languages to do your procedural code
* can be slow, can be a security issue
* if can move computation to database that's better

### SQL Functions
Define in a DDL way
```SQL
CREATE FUNCTION dept_count(dept_name VARCHAR(20))
    RETURNS INTEGER
    BEGIN
    DECLARE d_count INTEGER;
        SELECT count(*) INTO d_count
        FROM instructor
        WHERE instructor.dept_name = dept_name
    RETURN d_count
END
```

### Procedures
Another mechanism for executing code, but passing out / returning is different
